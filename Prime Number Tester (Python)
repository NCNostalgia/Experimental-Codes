'''
Prime number tester and next prime number finder by Jeff [12/30/2017].
This program can process any integer between 1 and 1000000. Input any number beyond that range at your own risk.
I'd love to hear your feedback on this as well! Please tell me if there's anything I can improve on. Thanks. :)
