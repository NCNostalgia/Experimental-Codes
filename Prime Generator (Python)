Prime Number Generator by Jeff.
(I've also made an equivalent program in Java. You can check it out here: https://code.sololearn.com/cQrN08jRkxqL/#java)
Can easily compute prime numbers below 5000. Enter higher values at your own risk.
Feedback is much appreciated! Please let me know if there's anything I can improve on. :D

x = int(input("Highest number to consider: "))
assert x > 1,"Your number isn't prime."
print(x)
primes = [2]

def addprimes(i):
    for j in primes:
        if i % j == 0:
            break
    else:
        primes.append(i)

for k in range(3,x + 1,2): # A faster method might require a more complicated "step" calculation.
    addprimes(k)

print("Your primes within the range %i are: " % x, ", ".join(list(map(str,primes))))
